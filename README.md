# Experimental Robotics LAB: First Assignment

## Introduction

The main purpose of this project is to design a **behavioral architecture** that simulates a robot pet interacting with a human. In particular, the human can interact by **pointing gesture** and **speech commands** in order to *activate* the robots and make it move to a desired position. If the robot doesn't receive any command, however it can follow other two different behavior:

* **Normal**: in which it moves randomly
* **Sleep**: in which it reaches a predefined location and waits for some time
